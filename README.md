# Euclid

A minimalist zsh prompt inspired by [geometry](https://github.com/geometry-zsh/geometry).

## ðŸš§  UNDER CONSTRUCTION ðŸš§

I'm still developing this theme for my own personal use. I don't even intend to make it customizable (like geometry) at this point. I just want to get something working for my own needs, then be able to refer to the theme using a zsh plugin manager.
